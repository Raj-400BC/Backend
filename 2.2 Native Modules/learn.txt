- We are using 'File System' here to writeFile and readFile.
- In 'index.js' , we are first creating the .txt file then we are accessing it.
- But when we run 'readFile.js' , we can see error . That error is comming because we are trying to access the content 'trail.txt' but we have not yet created that.
